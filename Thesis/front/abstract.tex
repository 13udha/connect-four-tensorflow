\chapter{Abstract}
In this bachelor thesis I am exploring reinforcement learning in the area of games. Therefore, an implementation of this procedure was used for the game Connect Four. Furthermore, a test was made to proof that the implementation could be optimized with the addition of a way to learn what your enemie did. This was shown to have a minimal positive impact.
