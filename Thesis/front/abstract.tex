\chapter{Abstract}
In this bachelor thesis we are exploring reinforcement learning in the area of games. Therfore an implementation of this procedure was used for the game Connect Four. Furthermore a test was made to proof that the implementation could be optimized with the addition of a way to learn what your enemie did. This was shown to have a minimal positive impact.
